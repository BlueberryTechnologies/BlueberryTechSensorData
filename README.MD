# Blueberry Tech Sensor Data

---

## This repository houses our very basic in house monitoring system for our server

## There is a bash script that goes along with, but is not in this repository as of yet

---

### Functionality

- If you are wanting to use this as monitoring for your machine, ensure it runs a version of Linux, or MacOS
- When the bash script is ran, it writes values to a variety of files within the system
- The HTML website looks at a JavaScript script which calls requests to these files to get the data
- The data is then displayed on the website and updates every 1 minute and 1 second
